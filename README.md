# Beeps and Boops

## Overview
This repository contains the code for our 2022 Discrete Math final project, which uses graph theory to analyze song data and create playlists. We created both weighted and unweighted graphs using song similarity to represent a playlist of songs, then used both BFS and Dijkstra's Algorithm to generate smooth playlists. We also analyzed cliques within these graphs.
